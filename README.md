# Simple RPG

Made with SDL as a side project to learn game dev & C++.

Engine wrapper has been created to enable the creating reusable module for future projects.

## Engine Interface
- Sprite drawing, really basic right now, with full and partial drawing
- Save/Load buffer to file.
- Read keyboard state, Hold, Pressed, Released.

## Current Plan August
- Level Editor
- Tile Collision
- Camera
- Simple Audio
- Classic Entity System (No component), a basic one, create, update, destroy entity. Allow characters creation.

## Final Plan
- Item / Inventory
- Quest
- Combat behaviour
- Game Event Scripting
- Open GL update
